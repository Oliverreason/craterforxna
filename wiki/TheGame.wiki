#summary Concept and storyline

= Concept =

== Backgrounds ==
In the year 2010 a human race found themselves facing a terrible threat. A huge meteorite, designated as 703-H Hephaestus was abruptly discovered, and it was on a collision course with the earth. With almost certain probability of a collision and destruction of the earth, the United Nations launched an unparalleled mission in the history of human kind to destroy the incoming threat. The mission was a success.

All fragments either passed the earth or burned in the atmosphere. Only one fragment survived to hit the earth. It striked to lapland in Finland with no casualties.

A company behind the funding of meteorite operation went immediately investigate the fragment in the lapland. After a couple weeks of research the expedition faced strange deaths among the scientists. 

The meteorite fragment didn't come alone. It was habited by primitive organisms that can invade the human body forming a symbiosis with the host. They give a unique power to any human who is exposured with them, which also was the reason for the mysterious deaths in the camp. The powers overcharged in the hosts and erupted uncontrollably killing any unlucky scientists who was near.

7 years after the collision a reasearch center CRATER shades the lands around the meteorite.


== Present ==
Crater employs hundreds of men around the clock. Doctors, scientists, guards, management, engineers etc. The Crater is a small town where employees lives with their families because no one is allowed to leave the Crater since the nature and delicacy of the project.

Scientists in the Crater have been struggling to solve four main problems related on the living organism. The most important one is how to create more organisms or increase the multiplication speed. Currently the population stays in the same level when injected into a host. But if the organism does not have a host, it is not able to have mitosis for some reason and eventually the population would die.

The second problem was how to keep the organism alive outside of the meteorite's radiation range. Meteorite produces neutrinoless double beta decay that keeps the organism alive but does not harm human body as the radiation level is low enough. Couple of weeks ago, a solution for this problem was found and scientist have made the first successfull test with a prototype serum.

The last two are how to control the organism not to harm human body when they are injected. The more you have them in you, the more probably you will lose control of yourself. Injection also has huge probability to damage certain tissues or inflict serious DNA mutation or allergy reactions. The last problem has not yet any significant results, but scientists have produced a formula that will slightly reduce the probability of any inflics when injecting the organism in human body.

== The Plot ==

=== Prologue ===
You are an employee in the Crater. You start your first day at the Crater and show your ID card at the gate for the guard. Here you create your character and choose the department where you were employed at. As you have created your character, you'll receive your first task "Find your department". 

As you find your department you will do assignments that you receive from your supervisor. Later you are working in the main lab in the lowest levels of the complex (doing research, fixing, interviewing, guarding etc.) when everything started. Scientists have found a way to increase the multiplication speed of the organism.

=== Crater in chaos ===
Suddenly happy faces around you turns to faces of agony. People are running and dying around you. Flames overruns the laboratory and you need to get out as soon as possible. It doesn't take long to realize that people behind the massacre was the ones who have Hephaestus (the organism) injection.

If the organism has taken some of the host's control, the host will act very unpredictable way. The most common behaviour is to find other injected and try to seize their organisms for themselves.

.... you have an injection ....

=== Host of the Hephaestus === 
You have now Hephaestus in you, but luckily don't notice any side effects, nor any effects. You have to find out the special powers the symbiont gives you. You have to learn the way how to live with the symbiont. Your main target is still to get out of the Crater as soon as possible, but it ain't going to be any easier with the symbiont. Organism gives an ability to sense every Hephaestus near you and there are ones that wants to boost their powers by taking your symbiont for themselves.
