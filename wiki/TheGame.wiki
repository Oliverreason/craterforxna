#summary Concept and storyline

= Concept =

== Backgrounds ==
In the year 2010 a human race found themselves facing a terrible threat. A huge meteorite, designated as 703-H Hephaestus was abruptly discovered, and it was on a collision course with the earth. With almost certain probability of a collision and destruction of the earth, the United Nations launched an unparalleled mission in the history of human kind to destroy the incoming threat. The mission was a success.

All fragments either passed the earth or burned in the atmosphere. Only one fragment survived to hit the earth. It striked to lapland in Finland.

A company behind the funding of meteorite operation went immediately investigate the fragment in the lapland. After a couple weeks of research the expedition faced strange deaths among the scientists. Eventually all but four men were dead.

The meteorite fragment didn't come alone. It was habited by primitive organisms that can invade the human body forming a symbiosis with the host. They give a unique power to any human who is exposured with them, which also was the reason for the mysterious deaths in the camp. Anyway 

Men behind the deaths were three company leaders as they did not want the public to know about their inhuman powers and witnesses had to be killed. Two of them left the crater as one stayed to take charge of the camp and the lead biologist who discovered the reason of the powers.

7 years after the collision a reasearch center CRATER shades the lands around the meteorite.


== Present ==
Crater employs hundreds of men around the clock. Doctors, scientists, guards, management, engineers etc. The Crater is a small town where employees lives with their families because no one is allowed to leave the Crater since the nature and delicacy of the project.

Scientists in the Crater have been struggling to solve four main problems related on the living organism. The most important one is how to create more organisms or increase the multiplication speed. Currently the population stays almost in the same level when injected into a host. But if the organism does not have a host, it is not able to have mitosis for some reason and eventually the population would die.

The second problem was how to keep the organism alive outside of the meteorite's radiation range. Meteorite produces neutrinoless double beta decay that keeps the organism alive but does not harm human body as the radiation level is low enough. Couple of weeks ago, a solution for this problem was found and scientist have made the first successfull test with a prototype serum.

The last two are how to control the organism not to harm human body when they are injected. The more you have them in you, the more probably you will lose control of yourself. Injection also has huge probability to damage certain tissues or inflict serious DNA mutation or allergy reactions. The last problem has not yet any significant results, but scientists have produced a formula that will slightly reduce the probability of any inflics when injecting the organism in human body.

== The Plot ==

=== Prologue ===
You were an employee of the company. You was working in the project lapland 7 years ago and now you are at home when someone knocks the door. As you open it you see two dark suited men who wants you to go with them. You cant argue since your legs can't carry you anymore as you lose consciousness. 

You don't know how long has been gone since the blackout nor don't know where you are. It is some kind of heavy secured cell with no windows.

=== Crater in chaos ===
Suddenly people start to scream and run around in a horror. People are running and dying, flames overruns the laboratory and the electricity went off. People behind the massacre was the ones who have Hephaestus (the organism) injection. Soon the cell gates open.

If the organism has taken some of the host's control, the host will act very unpredictable way. The most common behaviour is to find other injected and try to seize their organisms for themselves.

=== Host of the Hephaestus === 
You have the Hephaestus in you, but luckily don't notice any side effects, nor any effects. You have to find out the special powers the symbiont gives you. You have to learn the way how to live with the symbiont. Your main target is still to get out of the Crater as soon as possible, but it ain't going to be any easier with the symbiont. Organism gives an ability to sense every Hephaestus near you and there are ones that wants to boost their powers by taking your symbiont for themselves.
